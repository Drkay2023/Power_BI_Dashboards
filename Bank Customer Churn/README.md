## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a bank's customer data to understand churn patterns and build visualizations to gain actionable insights. The dashboard was built using **Power BI** and focuses on identifying **why customers leave (churn)** and how to **reduce future churn**.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

- The original dataset contained inconsistent, messy rows with multiple delimiters and mixed values.
- Using **Power BI Power Query**, the data was:
  - Split by common delimiters (commas, semicolons, slashes, pipes).
  - Cleaned of whitespace and non-relevant characters (like parentheses).
  - Grouped by common occupations (e.g., all roles with "engineer" grouped under **Engineer**).
  - Transformed into a normalized tabular format for easier visualization.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **High churn rates** were noticed among customers in certain job groups such as **Sales**, **Technicians**, and **Blue Collar** roles.
- Customers with **lower balance and tenure** had a higher probability of churning.
- **Female customers** showed slightly higher churn rates.
- Customers without **credit cards** or **active accounts** were more likely to churn.

## 💡 Recommendations to Reduce Churn

1. **Introduce loyalty programs** for long-tenure customers.
2. **Improve engagement** with customers who are inactive or not using credit cards.
3. **Provide tailored financial advice** to customers in at-risk occupations.
4. **Use predictive analytics** to flag churn-prone customers early.
