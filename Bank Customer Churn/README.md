## 📊 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a bank's customer data to understand churn patterns and build visualizations to gain actionable insights. The dashboard was built using **Power BI** and focuses on identifying **why customers leave (churn)** and how to **reduce future churn**.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

- The original dataset contained inconsistent, messy rows with multiple delimiters and mixed values.
- Using **Power BI Power Query**, the data was:
  - Split by common delimiters (commas, semicolons, slashes).
  - Cleaned of whitespace and non-relevant characters (like parentheses).
  - Grouped by common occupations (e.g., all roles with "engineer" grouped under **Engineer**).
  - Transformed into a normalized tabular format for easier visualization.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Customers with **more complaints** were more likely to churn.
- Churned customers used **fewer products** and had **lower credit scores**.
- Surprisingly, **high-income customers** churned more(an expensive loss for the bank).
- Customers aged **60+** and those in **SME segment** showed the bhighest churn rates.
- **Male Customers** churned more due to **service issues/account closures** while **female customers** churned more due to **relocation.**
- **Professionals** like lawyers, programmers, nurses and fundraisers had high loan to income ratios and also had high churn rates.

## 💡 Recommendations to Reduce Churn

1. The bank should **proactively engage high income customers** who have frequent complaints and low product usage. Understanding their pain points may reduce churn.
2. Customers with **high loan-to-income ratios** and **low credit scores** should be targeted with **financial planning support** or **retention incentives.**
3. **Tailored communication and retention strategies** should be applied based on age, gender, and customer segment insights (e.g., SMEs and elderly clients).
