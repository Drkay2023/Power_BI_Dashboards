# Chicken Republic (Lagos) Dashboard Analysis

## Personal Note

I am a big fan of Chicken Republic and I absolutley love their products especially their Chicken. This prompted me to work on a personal project with publicly available dataset.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of Chicken Republic branches in Lagos for the first half of 2024. The objective is to understand customer behavior, identify high and low performing outlets, track peak days and months  and uncover strategic insights that can help improve sales performance and customer satisfaction.

- **Power BI**: For data preprocessing using Power Query, interactive dashboard creation and visualization.

##  Key Insights

1. **Top-Selling Product**: Ice Cream leads overall in quantity sold and total sales. This is subject to change when  analyzing the data on a monthly basis. For example Chicken Pie is the top sellibng Product bin Feburary.
2. **Location Performance**: Victoria Island tops overall in both sales and profit while Yaba performs the worst. This is subject to change when  analyzing the data on a monthly basis.
3. **Product Categories**: Sales and profits are almost equally split among Desserts, Drinks, Meals, and Snacks.
4. **Sales Growth**: Sales skyrocketed in April with a monthly growth rate with a 20% while growth rate fell sharply in June with -39% of sales.
5. **High Profit Margin Products**: Fanta, Cake Slice, Sausage Roll, Coke, and Meat Pie have high margins but aren’t top sellers.
6. **Peak Sales Time Frame**: Overall, midweek days (Wednesday and Thursdays) record the highest sales while the month of April recorded the most sales, also Q2 had more sales recorded (with desserts having the highest sales) than Q1 (with meals having the most sales recorded).

##  Problems Identified

- **Underutilized High Margin Items**: High profit products are not being pushed.
- **Underperforming Branches**: Yaba underdelivers in both profit and sales.
- **No Dominant Category**: No focused sales strategy by product category.

   - Introduce hyper-local promotions(like a "Yaba only" package) and menu improvements.

   - Seasonal offers: “Dessert Week”, “Family Pack Fridays”.
   - Digital coupons or app exclusive discounts.

4. **Focus Product Categories**
   - Choose a flagship category to promote (e.g., Meals).
   - Create meal packs or family size portions.

5. **Improve Upsell & Placement**
   - Train staff to upsell high margin products.
